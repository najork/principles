### Core Beliefs

- Maintain a set of non-negotiable core beliefs; everything else is up for discussion
  - Don't be afraid to be a contrarian; as a corollary, being a contrarian is useless unless you maintain your core beliefs in the presence of emotion and external pressure
  - Expose yourself to new ideas, challenge your beliefs, and change your opinions in light of new data
- You're not taking on enough risk if you're not failing
  - Failure leads to growth but repeatedly failing in the same manner signals a problem
- Comfort implies complacency; actively seek discomfort
- Use tools and implement processes in your life to free up mental cycles for solving novel and new problems
  - Optimize on automating or otherwise cutting down time spent on highly repetitive tasks

### General

#### Prioritization

- Optimize on solving problems which provide the most value with the shortest time horizon; as a corollary, don't solely pursue local optima at the expense of a global optimum
- Focus on problems which (1) matter and (2) you are uniquely capable of solving
- A task which is not tracked will not get finished

#### Learning

- Optimize for learning and growth which results in compounding dividends

#### Communication

- Value direct and transparent communication
- Don't be an asshole
