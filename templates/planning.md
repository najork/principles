1. Bottoms-up generation. List project candidates.
2. Top-down validation. Review project candidates against strategic goals and ensure that there aren't any coverage gaps.
3. Prioritization and ranking. Prioritize projects (e.g. P0/P1/P2) and stack rank.
4. Estimate work. Assign each project a "rough level of effort" estimate. For example, it will take two people one month to complete a project.
5. Determine what can be committed to based on priority, capacity, working period length, and work estimates.
6. Map committed projects to key results.
7. Final validation. Validate that the commitments align with the strategic goals, and that there isn't any extraneous work.
