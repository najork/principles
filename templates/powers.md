# Powers for durable and differentiated returns

## Network Effects

What: The value of a service to each user increases as new users join the network. Note that a company's network effects must be meaningfully differentiated from the competition in order for it to be a power.

Example: Uber is a multi-sided platform with network effects. However, Lyft has the same network effects so it's not differentiated.

## Cornered Resource

What: A business that leverages a cornered resource has preferential access at attractive terms to a coveted asset that can independently enhance value.

Example: Pixar had an early group of individuals who developed their early movies together and learned how to work together in a creative way. Since then, they’ve been a cornered resource, comprising the talent that it takes to make these digital films. The entire group is the cornered resource.

## Scale Economies

What: A business in which per unit cost declines as production volume increases.

Example: Netflix’s cost of content per viewer went down with scale.

## Switching Costs

What: Stickiness of your product can protect you from the forces of competition if it locks your customers in.

Example: Migrating from AWS to another cloud provider is expensive.

## Counter Positioning

What: A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business.

Example: Cloudflare competing with AWS S3 by undercutting their egress cost. Amazon relies on cheap ingress and expensive egress to lock people into their ecosystem, and reducing their egress cost would damage their moat.

## Brand

What: The durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering that arises from historic info about the seller.

Example: People are willing to pay a premium for Apple products because of the brand.

## Process Power

What: Embedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs and/or a superior product.

Example: Toyota's manufacturing process is streamlined and optimized.
